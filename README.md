```

```

5. **Local Development:** Run the following command to preview your Jekyll site locally:

```

## Usage

Wind has been scaffolded by the `jekyll new-theme` command and therefore has all the necessary files and directories to have a new Jekyll site up and running with zero-configuration.

### Layouts

Refers to files within the `_layouts` directory, that define the markup for your theme.

  - `base.html` &mdash; The base layout that lays the foundation for subsequent layouts. The derived layouts inject their
    contents into this file at the line that says ` {{ content }} ` and are linked to this file via
    [FrontMatter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) declaration `layout: base`.
  - `home.html` &mdash; The layout for your landing-page / home-page / index-page. [[More Info.](#home-layout)]
  - `page.html` &mdash; The layout for your documents that contain FrontMatter, but are not posts. Example about.md page.
  - `post.html` &mdash; The layout for your posts.
  - `galley.html` &mdash; The layout for a image galley.

#### Home Layout

`home.html` is a flexible HTML layout for the site's landing-page / home-page / index-page. 

##### *Main Heading and Content-injection*

The *home* layout will inject all content from your `index.md` / `index.html` **before** the **`Posts`** section. This will allow you to include non-posts related content to be published on the landing page under a dedicated heading. *I recommended that you title this section with a Heading2 (`##`)*.

#### Gallery Layout

This Layout needs a data file with the name `_data/gallery.yml` and the following structure:
```
photos:
  - url: path/to/your/photo.png
    description: Alt for the image
    quote: text on hover
```

### Includes

Refers to snippets of code within the `_includes` directory that can be inserted in multiple layouts (and another include-file as well) within the same theme-gem.

  - `disqus_comments.html` &mdash; Code to markup disqus comment box.
  - `footer.html` &mdash; Defines the site's footer section.
  - `head.html` &mdash; Code-block that defines the `<head></head>` in *default* layout.
  - `custom-head.html` &mdash; Placeholder to allow users to add more metadata to `<head />`.
  - `header.html` &mdash; Defines the site's main header section. By default, pages with a defined `title` attribute will have links displayed here.
  - `navbar.html` &mdash; Defines the site's navbar section. By default, `title` is used in the left section and main pages are displayed in the rigth section.
  - `up_button.html` &mdash; Includes the code related to the up button.


## Configuration

The template needs at least `title` and `author` settings in your `_config.yml` for works fine. The title is used in the nabvar section and the author is displayed in the posts.

### Enabling comments (via Disqus)

Optionally, if you have a Disqus account, you can tell Jekyll to use it to show a comments section below each post.

:warning: `url`, e.g. `https://example.com`, must be set in you config file for Disqus to work.

To enable it, after setting the url field, you also need to add the following lines to your Jekyll site:

```yaml
  disqus:
    shortname: my_disqus_shortname
```

You can find out more about Disqus' shortnames [here](https://help.disqus.com/installation/whats-a-shortname).

Comments are enabled by default and will only appear in production, i.e., `JEKYLL_ENV=production`

If you don't want to display comments for a particular post you can disable them by adding `comments: false` to that post's YAML Front Matter.

## Customization

To override the default structure and style of minima, simply create the concerned directory at the root of your site, copy the file you wish to customize to that directory, and then edit the file.
e.g., to override the [`_includes/head.html `](_includes/head.html) file to specify a custom style path, create an `_includes` directory, copy `_includes/head.html` from minima gem folder to `<yoursite>/_includes` and start editing that file.

### Footer

To customize the text in the footer:

1. Declare your site language in the `_config.yml` file:

   ```yaml
   language: "your_language_code"
   ```

2. Create a language `data` file in the data folder, using your site language code (e.g., `es.yml` for Spanish).

3. Customize the footer variables in the language data file:

    ```yml
    footer:
      title: "Mantengamosnos conectados"
      description: "Puesdes encontrarme en cualquiera de estos canales:"
      pages: "Paginas"
    ```
Adjust the values of title, description, and pages as needed.

### Plugins

Minima comes with [`jekyll-seo-tag`](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag) plugin preinstalled to make sure your website gets the most useful meta tags. See [usage](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag#usage) to know how to set it up.
